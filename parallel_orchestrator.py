"""
Parallel Orchestrator
=====================

Unified orchestrator that handles all agent lifecycle:
- Initialization: Creates features from app_spec if needed
- Coding agents: Implement features one at a time
- Testing agents: Regression test passing features (optional)

Uses dependency-aware scheduling to ensure features are only started when their
dependencies are satisfied.

Usage:
    # Entry point (always uses orchestrator)
    python autonomous_agent_demo.py --project-dir my-app --concurrency 3

    # Direct orchestrator usage
    python parallel_orchestrator.py --project-dir my-app --max-concurrency 3
